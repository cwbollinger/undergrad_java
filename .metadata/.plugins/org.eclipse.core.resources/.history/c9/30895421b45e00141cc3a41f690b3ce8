I used a radix-based sum as my first hash function, and a simple sum-mod hash for my second hash function.
I used the radix-based hash because it used the order and value of the key data to create the hash.
I used the sum-mod hash for my second hash function because I was not getting many collisions, and it is fast to calculate.
