I used a radix-based sum as my first hash function, and a simple sum-mod hash for my second hash function.
I used the radix-based hash because it used the order and value of the key data to create the hash.
I used the sum-mod hash for my second hash function because I was not getting many collisions during hashing,
and it is fast to calculate.

The radix-based hash does a good job of spreading values out across the table. The second hash is less effective,
but since it is used relatively infrequently, I did not notice much secondary clustering in the hash tables.

The collision avoidance strategy was to jump forward in the table by the value of hash(2) every time a collision occured.
This performed as expected, and did not result in significant clustering in the table.
